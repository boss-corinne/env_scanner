INTEGRATED TESTING

This is essentially a large collection (suite) of unit tests which are run together to assess the performance and reliability of the wider system.

There are several types of Integration Tests, mainly:

1. Big Bang Integration
All components are tested with other components at once.

2. Bottom-up Integration
Lowest-level components are tested with the next level up first, and testing continues upwards.

This type of testing is good for identifying bugs and errors in specific modules.

3. Top-down Integration
Highest-level components are tested first, testing continues downwards.

This type of testing is good for testing links between modules, so stubs can be used.


CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

This is a set of automated tests that are run on a continous delivery basis; that is, with all individual small changes in a source control repository.
These tests are designed to reflect business goals and user stories, and as such are executed in a bottom-up configuration.  
However, they should also cover the system requirements of the client, so efficiency of the software should also be tested in this suite.
Some tests included in this suite should be destructive; that is to say, to deliberately feed the programme incorrect inputs to test its exception handling ability.
