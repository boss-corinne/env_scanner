INTEGRATED TESTING

This is essentially a large collection (suite) of unit tests which are run together to assess the performance and reliability of the wider system.

There are several types of Integration Tests, mainly:

1. Big Bang Integration
All components are tested with other components at once.

2. Bottom-up Integration
Lowest-level components are tested with the next level up first, and testing continues upwards.

This type of testing is good for identifying bugs and errors in specific modules.

3. Top-down Integration
Highest-level components are tested first, testing continues downwards.

This type of testing is good for testing links between modules, so stubs can be used.
