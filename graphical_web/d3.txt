This is a library written in javascript which can be used to construct data 
visualizations (such as charts, graphs and other more inventive graphics) for 
web pages.

The functionality to do this was already present in other libraries, but D3 was
specifically designed to make this easier and more flexible, allowing the user 
to be more inventive and creative.  It is also designed to be very fast, which 
is essential for ever-increasing content sizes in web-based graphics.

D3 uses SVG, CSS and HTML.  

CodePen is an online playground for D3 (and possibly other toys).  
I haven't fully got my head around it yet:
