Amazon AWS
==========

Amazon host several very large datasets (~Tb) in the cloud, which can be accessed and used publicly.

These datasets could be very useful for Iris examples; the current size and load time of Iris is unreasonabl;e large, so using cloud-based example data instead of Iris-contained large datasets could be a way to reduce the size of Iris.
