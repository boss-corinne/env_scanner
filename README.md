# learning

This repo is entirely for my own benefit, and is intended to house the learning materials I accrue in my career at the Met Office.


## Reminders

1. Where your .pth files live:

    /home/h06/cbosley/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    
2. How to symlink:

    ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/symlink
    
3. How to check the disk usage (file sizes) of stuff in my home space:

    du -sh *
    
4. Rebasing:

    git rebase -i HEAD~number-of-commits-to-squash

    git rebase --abort
