GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATES SYSTEMS: NOTES AND TERMS

Geoid:
A spheroid representing the shape of the Earth (or a planet) at mean sea level 
only (i.e. the shape the Earth would be if all the land was taken away and we 
were looking at just the sea).

GCS (Geographic Coordinate System):
An imaginary spheroid used to define locations on the Earth.  
It is imaginary because to define any point, you would need an angular unit of 
measure, a prime meridian and a datum.  
From these variables, any point can be calculated.

Semi-major/semi-minor axes:
When a spheroid is oblate (based on an ellipse, not a circle), it has one radius
longer than the other.  The longer of the two is the semi-major axis, and the 
shorter is the semi-minor axis.

Flattening:
The difference in length between the two axes as a fraction or decimal 
f = (a - b) / a
Where f = flattening, a = semimajor axis and b = semiminor axis.

Inverse flattening:
1/f 
This is used because f is often too small.

WGS84 (World Geodetic System of 1984):
This is the commonly-accepted Earth spheroid, with variables as follows:
a = 6378137.0 metres
1/f = 298.257223563
*This is not the be-all and end-all, just the default spheroid.  The Earth is 
not a perfect spheroid, and different spheroids fit different regions best.*

Datum:
This is the position of the spheroid relative to the centre of the Earth:

Often the spheroid is off-centre (shown by the image on this link), so the datum 
provides the local offset.
The WGS84 datum provides the framework for location measurement worldwide.
The geocentric datum uses the Earth's centre of mass as the origin.

Projections:
This is a flat, 2-dimensional map.  This is not accurate because the lengths, 
angles and areas across both latitudes and longitudes are constant.  In a GCS 
(the world on a spheroid), lats converge but are the same length, and longs are 
parallel but differing lengths.
In a projection, lats and longs are all parallel and of equal length, so some 
distortion of shape takes place.

    Conformal Projection:
    This is a projection designed to preserve local shape.  It does this by 
    representing the intersection of local graticules lines at 90 degree angles, 
    thus preserving the angles between local spatial points.

    Equal Area Projection:
    This is a projection designed to preserve the area of displayed features.  
    This is achieved by distorting other properties such as shape and scale, and 
    intersections between meridians and parallels may not be perpendicular.

    Equidistant Projection:
    This preserves the distance between chosen points, but this is to the expense of
    other distances.  In this projection, true distances are those for which their 
    length is the same as that on a globe.  

    Lambert Conic Conformal Projection:
    Conical projection of a globe.  Central parallels are spaced more closely than 
    parallels near the border, and small geographic shapes are maintained for both 
    small-scale and large-scale maps.

    Albers Equal Area Conic Projection:
    Conical projection of a globe.  Parallels near the norhtern and southern edges 
    are closer together than central parallels, and the projection displays 
    equivalent areas.

    Mercator Projection:
    Cylindrical projection of a globe, usually with the equator as its line of 
    tangency.  Meridians are geometrically projected onto the cylindrical surface, 
    and parallels are mathematically projected.

    Transverse Mercator Projection:
    Cylindrical projection of a globe, usually with the prime meridian as its line 
    of tangency.

Coordinate Types:
    Geographic:
    Standard lat-lon coordinates (2D)
    
    Geocentric:
    (X, Y, Z) coordinates relating to the origin (3D, from centre)

    Geodetic:
    (X, Y, Z) coordinates relating to normal from surface point 
    (3D, from norm intersection with equatorial plane)
